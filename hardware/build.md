[Expansion board](bom/BOM_expansion_board_nordhat.csv)

***It is suggested to proceed in the order listed below.***

## Main board

#### 1) SMD components
Start by soldering the SMD components: nine 10k resistors and nine 100n ceramic capacitors.

#### 2) Headers

#### 3) Buttons and encoders.

#### 4) OLED display.
Make sure the display sits flush with the main board and is correctly aligned.

## Expansion board

#### 1) WM8731 DAC.

#### 2) Ceramic capacitors and resistors.

#### 3) Electrolytic capacitors, the crystal and the 5V regulator.

#### 4) 02x07 header and the jack connectors.

## Assembling the two boards

Mount the two boards and the panels together using the standoffs and the screws.
