# Build instructions

## Main board

#### Solder the SMD components
Start by soldering the SMD components: nine 10k resistors and nine 100n ceramic capacitors.

#### Solder the headers

#### Solder the buttons and encoders.

#### Solder the OLED display.
Make sure the display sits flush with the main board and is correctly aligned.

## Expansion board

#### Solder the WM8731 DAC.

#### Solder the ceramic capacitors and resistors.

#### Solder the electrolytic capacitors, the crystal and the 5V regulator.

#### Solder the 02x07 header and the jack connectors.

## Assembling the two boards

Mount the two boards and the panels together using the standoffs and the screws.
