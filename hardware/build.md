# Build instructions

It is suggested to proceed in the order listed below.

## Main board

#### SMD components
Start by soldering the SMD components: nine 10k resistors and nine 100n ceramic capacitors.

#### Headers

#### Buttons and encoders.

#### OLED display.
Make sure the display sits flush with the main board and is correctly aligned.

## Expansion board

#### WM8731 DAC.

#### Ceramic capacitors and resistors.

#### Electrolytic capacitors, the crystal and the 5V regulator.

#### 02x07 header and the jack connectors.

## Assembling the two boards

Mount the two boards and the panels together using the standoffs and the screws.
