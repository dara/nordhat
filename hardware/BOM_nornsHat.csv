,Switches,SW_MEC_5ETH920Q,3,Switches,APEM 5ETH920Q,"We’re low actuation force key switches, but feel free to use another actuation force, in the same 5E series or 5G* You’ll need to modify the panels in consequence if you use a 5G series. ",
,SW3,RotaryEncoder_Bourns_Vertical_H20mm_PEC11R,3,Rotary_Encoders,PEC11R-4015K-N0024 (T18),"We’re using encoders without detent and without switch, T18. The shortest available in this series. Use PEC11R-4015F-N0024 if you want D_Shaft terminaison. Find a reference in the same series if you want to use a different length.",
